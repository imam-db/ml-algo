# Supervised Learning

🏠 Back to Main: `../README.md`

This section groups supervised learning algorithms under a consistent folder pattern:
- `README.md` — theory overview and when to use
- `implementation.py` — from-scratch (NumPy) implementation
- `sklearn_example.py` — scikit-learn usage examples
- `exercise.ipynb` — hands-on exercises

Modules (available/planned):
- `01_linear_regression/` — Linear Regression (available)
- `02_logistic_regression/` — Logistic Regression (coming soon)
- `03_decision_trees/` — Decision Trees (coming soon)
- `04_random_forest/` — Random Forest (coming soon)
- `05_svm/` — Support Vector Machine (coming soon)
- `06_naive_bayes/` — Naive Bayes (coming soon)
- `07_knn/` — K-Nearest Neighbors (coming soon)
- `08_neural_networks/` — Neural Networks (coming soon)

If a link is not yet available, the content is under development.
