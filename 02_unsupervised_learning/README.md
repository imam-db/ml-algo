# Unsupervised Learning

🏠 Back to Main: `../README.md`

Unsupervised algorithms for discovering patterns without labels. Folder pattern:
- `README.md` — short theory and when to use
- `implementation.py` — from-scratch implementation (optional)
- `sklearn_example.py` — scikit-learn examples
- `exercise.ipynb` — interactive exercises

Modules (planned):
- `01_kmeans/` — K-Means Clustering (coming soon)
- `02_hierarchical_clustering/` — Hierarchical Clustering (coming soon)
- `03_dbscan/` — DBSCAN (coming soon)
- `04_pca/` — Principal Component Analysis (coming soon)
- `05_tsne/` — t-SNE (coming soon)
- `06_association_rules/` — Association Rules (coming soon)

If a folder is empty, content is being prepared.
